###  About computers and me

The feeling of awe and wonder when I opened and used a Terminal on Linux for the first time never really left. 
To me, computers are akin to magical swords and I'm commited to learning and mastering their capabilities. 
I love solving programming/coding challenges. Solving programming challenges brings me immense satisfaction, 
and I cherish those moments when code finally runs smoothly after debugging.

Currently, I'm enrolled in a full-time Python programming course at DCI while also 
sharing my knowledge as a programming tutor.

### Other stuff I enjoy

Outside of the digital realm, I find joy in playing guitar, practicing WingChun Kung Fu, and climbing. 
Books and poetry serve as sources of inspiration and beauty in my life.

Thanks for taking the time to explore my profile. Feel free to browse through my projects!

## Hi there! My name is Christian - Welcome to my github 

###  About me and computers

The feeling of awe and wonder when opened and used a Terminal for the first time never really left. 
Basically, computers are magical swords and I intend to be able to wield it the best I can. 
I love solving programming/coding challenges. The feeling when something 
clicks and the code does exactly what I want it to do. 

That is why I am currently doing a Python Backend course at DCI. 
I am currently working as a tutor for my classmates.

### Other stuff I enjoy

There is a real world out there thats is also vast and amazing.  
I love playing guitar. For myself and with others. 
Climbing and WingChun Kung Fu give me balance and inner peace.
Books and poems are a source of beauty and inspiration for me.
